      release 0.3.1: A new release, because it seems ELF disassembly now works! 
--------------------------------0.3.1---------------------------------------------------------------

20051111:                                                                                           
      not yet a new release, but disassembling a linux executable is beginning to work in cvs ... 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20050627:
      release 0.3.0: I've finally completed the new gui! much faster than the original one, and
      with all the old functionality. So now I'm ready for the next step: adding a new binary to 
      disassemble ... 
--------------------------------0.3.0---------------------------------------------------------------

20050312:                            
      release 0.2.2 now enables disassembling without a gui ... 
--------------------------------0.2.2---------------------------------------------------------------

20050125:
      disassembly can now be saved in text and db format... 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20041110:
      I've made a 0.2 release: after finally upgrading to gnome 2.8 and improving performance a little bit... also of course because this programming effort has seen its second birthday... 
--------------------------------0.2.0---------------------------------------------------------------

20040801:
      I've begun adding recognition of parameters to functions, starting with parameters to known imports 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20040405:
      I've added some searching functionality: direct offset, searching a (string of) byte(s) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20031227:                                                                                           
      Finally completed all 80x87 co-processor instructions! 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20031019:                                                                                           
      This program's first anniversary ... I guess I've been programming away at this for about one year; 
      time probably to ask myself what I've got to show for it. 

      Well, all of the Intel 8086 instructions have been translated, and I've finally begun adding the 8087
      coprocessor instructions as well. Only one binary format is available, of course, the ubiquitous 
      windows PE. 

      But at least each time I had to add something, I was pleased with the ease that the data structures 
      I've arrived at, allowed this to be done with. So I guess... I will continue there is a future for
      this wonderful hobby project!                                                                 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20031005:	
Finally started with 80x87 instructions: because it seems that they really are used ... :-)
--------------------------------0.1.2---------------------------------------------------------------

20030817:	
Release 0.1.1 : because I finally got round to writing an 'options' dialog, allowing the user
		to confirm the type of disassembly, and so on...
--------------------------------0.1.1---------------------------------------------------------------

20030802:	
Release 0.1 with string parsing in the data sections ... 
--------------------------------0.1-----------------------------------------------------------------

20030615:
Windows PE imports are recognized!
--------------------------------0.0.4---------------------------------------------------------------

20030518:	  
I simplified the synchronisation between the master list of Disassembly_Nodes and the
gui counterpart... Gui_Synchronize makes for much simpler code than previous gui code.
--------------------------------0.0.3---------------------------------------------------------------

20030514:	  
Intel 80x86 instructions are complete!
--------------------------------0.0.2---------------------------------------------------------------


20030510:	  
Navigation works! I mean, when you double click a reference to memory or an instruction:
the gui shows the referenced element! Trapping the double click was a question of finding
the right event to hook into... and returning 'true' if we don't want the double click to be
taken into account anymore...

So I guess the next thing to do will be to try and recognize imports...
--------------------------------0.0.2---------------------------------------------------------------


20030501:	  
Incredibly... I've managed to fabricate a working set of Makefile.am and 
configure.in thingies... so ./configure and all that should work... from now on!

The aclocal part still remains a complete mystery though.

Navigating through the references is beginning to work...
and... I'm almost completely done with normal 80x86 instructions...
--------------------------------0.0.1---------------------------------------------------------------

20030421:	  
So, what does the program do, right now? 
-It disassembles most INTEL instructions 
	(75% of normal instructions and 0% of coprocessor instructions)
-It can recognize only one type of binary: a Windows PE, of which it will select the code sections
-It can show the result of the disassembly of this code section in the gui
-It can detect references to other portions of memory, and list them in the gui

that's it... for now!
--------------------------------0.0.0---------------------------------------------------------------

20030418: 										  
Well, I've finally done it... created a sourceforge project. If you have hours to waste,I guess
you could adapt the makefiles for your system, and compile this first 0.0 version...

But uploading the files really is only meant to show to the rest of the world that I have begun
writing this disassembler... I have a lot to learn about c++, gtk, and disassembly itself... but
what is a hobby programmer without a project?                                                       
--------------------------------0.0.0---------------------------------------------------------------
