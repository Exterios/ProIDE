For compiling binary data, e.g., images, into a C program.

Reads in a binary and creates C code on standard output that has
a character array that holds the binary data.  

I wrote this program because I found similar programs that had
arbitrary limits on the size of data.

Using the -n flag, you can change the name of the bin2c-generated
character array.

This program is free software -- think of it as a Valentine's Day
gift.  ;)
