Hello all,

For the time being, this is a one man project. Which of course means that I have a lot of ideas for the 
disassembler, but a lot less time to try and make them come true.

I would like 'disassembler' to be a versatile product that can disassemble different kinds of executables 
on different kinds of processors. But without help from others, I will only be able to do something for intel 
environments.

The code is written in C++, because I like the language, and it felt natural to try and make the 
inheritance model work for reusing common disassembly techniques on different sorts of input.
             
There is of course a commercial project available that does everything you would ever want a 
disassembler to do. But it only works on windows... My ultimate goal (dream?) is of reaching a state of
usability that equals theirs... 

Many greetings,
