The makefiles should permit by now to build the program without gnome,
making it at least possible to use the command line version, if you
don't have the libraries installed for the default gui...

      <ul>
The helper program parsing the windows header files finally works, so
this justifies a new release ... Perhaps the best thing to do next is
provide some documentation about the way the disassembler works...

works!

release 0.3.0: I've finally completed the new gui! much faster than the
original one, and with all the old functionality. So now I'm ready for
the next step: adding a new binary to disassemble ...

improving performance a little bit... also of course because this
programming effort has seen its second birthday...

This program's first anniversary ... I guess I've been programming away
at this for about one year; time probably to ask myself what I've got
to show for it.
      </ul>
      <ul>
Well, all of the Intel 8086 instructions have been translated, and I've
finally begun adding the 8087 coprocessor instructions as well. Only
one binary format is available, of course,
the ubiquitous windows PE.
      </ul>
      <ul>
But at least each time I had to add something, I was pleased with the
ease that the data
structures I've arrived at, allowed this to be done with. So I guess...
I will continue there is a future for this wonderful hobby project!

really are used ... :-)<!--

Navigation works! I mean, when you double click a reference to memory
or an instruction:
the gui shows the referenced element!
      </ul>
      <ul>
Trapping the double click was a question of finding
the right event to hook into... and returning 'true' if we don't want
the double click to be
taken into account anymore...
      </ul>
      <ul>
So I guess the next thing to do will be to try and recognize imports...

So, what does the program do, right now?
      </ul>
      <ul>
-It disassembles most INTEL instructions (90% of normal instructions
and 0% of coprocessor instructions)
      </ul>
      <ul>
-It can recognize only one type of binary: a Windows PE, of which it
will select the code sections
      </ul>
      <ul>
-It can show the result of the disassembly of this code section in the
gui
      </ul>
      <ul>
-It can detect references to other portions of memory, and list them in
the gui
      </ul>
      <ul>
that's it... for now...
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>

      <td>20030418:
      <ul>
Well, I've finally done it... created a sourceforge project. If you
have hours to waste,I guess
you could adapt the makefiles for your system, and compile this first
0.0 version...
      </ul>
      <ul>
But uploading the files really is only meant to show to the rest of the
world that I have begun
writing this disassembler... I have a lot to learn about c++, gtk, and
disassembly itself... but
what is a hobby programmer without a project?
