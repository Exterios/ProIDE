As a programmer I had started out learning from blodshed devc++ and visual basic 6 using dialup mostly waiting until much later to get into linux because of hardware modem prices. thanks to codeblocks wxsmith and QT creator for linux we can enjoy the flow of an actual devleopment environment and rapid prototyping gui's. I like to have an IDE for every language and GUI API. eventually I think a GUI editor will be implimented even if its just using GTK or WX possibly different plugins. we will have bash script support so alot of plugins can just be scripts.

http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/ could possibly include this into the main code but gcc should be suffice
